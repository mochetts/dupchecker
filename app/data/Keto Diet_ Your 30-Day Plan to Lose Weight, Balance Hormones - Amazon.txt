From the author of the national bestseller Eat Dirt, a 30-day healthy plan -- including more than 80 delicious recipes -- to burn fat, fight inflammation, and reverse disease using the keto diet.   
Today, the ketogenic diet is the world's fastest growing diet, and with good reason. When practiced correctly, it has been proven to burn fat, reduce inflammation, fight cancer, balance hormones and gut bacteria, improve neurological diseases, and even increase lifespan. Unfortunately, many people remain unaware of several key factors that are crucial to the diet's success, setting them up for frustration, failure, and relapse.  
In Keto Diet, bestselling author Dr. Josh Axe sets the record straight, offering thorough, step-by-step guidance to achieving lifelong health. Unlike other books on the subject, Keto Diet identifies and details five different ketogenic protocols and explains why picking the right one for your body and lifestyle is fundamental to your success.   
Inside, you'll find all the tools they need to say goodbye to stubborn fat and chronic disease once and for all, including:
shopping lists
delicious recipes
exercise routines
accessible explanations of the science behind keto's powerful effects
five different keto plans and a guide to choosing the one that fits you best!

Editorial Reviews 
Review
"Our dietary choices remain our most powerful ally in remaining healthy and combating disease. In Keto Diet, Dr. Josh Axe explores the emerging science that is converging around both the threat of carbohydrates and sugar as well as the powerfully salubrious benefits of a diet that augments our utilization of fat, and specifically ketones, to power our physiology. And beyond providing an in-depth exploration of this exciting science, Keto Diet provides the user-friendly tools that will allow every reader the chance to implement changes to regain and safeguard their health."―David Perlmutter, MD, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Grain Brain  
"If you're looking to lose weight, balance insulin, and boost your brain health, this book can change your life. Dr. Axe lays out a simple plan for following the Keto Diet the right way: by eating only nutrient-dense foods, like healthy fats, vegetables, herbs, and spices. If you're ready for a health breakthrough, this is the book for you." 
―Amy Myers, MD, author of The Thyroid Connection and The Autoimmune Solution   
"Keto Diet is a proven way to balance insulin, reduce inflammation and change your health forever. In his book Dr. Axe busts all of the common Keto myths and teaches you how to do the Ketogenic diet the right way."―Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times bestselling author of Food  
"Backed by science and Dr. Axe's own experience with patients, Keto Diet masterfully explains how setting your metabolism to the way humans functioned in ancient times reverses chronic diseases of today. Dr Axe's interest in health started with his mom getting sick, which gave him powerful motivation. It is obvious in his work that this pure, original intention is very much alive. I trust Dr. Axe as a source of information without reservation, and I highly recommend his book to anyone interested in getting healthy."―-Alejandro Junger, MD, author of Clean

3.0 out of 5 stars I'm not the right client for his program. 
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
I was super excited to get Keto Diet and I preordered it and got it the day it came out. I've been following Keto for the past year with moderate success. I follow Dr. Axe on social media and I genuinely thought he would offer deeper insight and help me find other ways to be successful. I tore through the book with excitement. But in the end I was disappointed. I know he is selling his book. Don't need to remind me every other page about Your Keto Diet book. I bought it already. He is offering pointers from healing naturally, but his prescriptions in here are way to expensive for my income. So, he caters to people who can afford all organic ingredients and supplements. No issue there. I just can't sustain that level even for 30 days. But good ideas and tips. I will take the tips I can use and keep following my poor man Keto diet sources. He does provide some good recipes that I will try, but I will stick with my other craveable Keto recipes in the meantime. So, the take away from me: just know the ingredients he pushes are all organic and not everyone else's Keto plan. I can't afford what he says I should do to follow this program. He says the bacon I love isn't ideal and he pushes turkey bacon or "beef" bacon. I have never heard of beef bacon and haven't found it in any store yet. He does make good sense as far as I can tell and is in line and maybe healthier then other Keto programs. As for me and my house, we'll glean what we can and make do with what we can actually find and afford.

4.0 out of 5 stars Best book on Keto, I wish I could give this a 4.5 star rating! 
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
I'm a big fan of Dr. Axe and his newest book Keto Diet doesn't disappoint. It's chockful of information and medical studies. I've read some other books on Keto and this one takes the cake. I also love how it's not all about weight loss (though it is a big part of it) but he discusses keto's benefit for brain health, hormones, and cancer. He also shares various plan options for your needs whether you are a vegan or battling cancer. I also liked there is a section on intermittent fasting and how it works well with keto. At the end of the book, he talks about keto cycling which I have heard both sides from different sources. I think it's a good plan for the long haul. I don't know if cycling carbs twice a week will work for everyone. I think for me it will end up in disaster lol. Maybe twice a month.... I think everyone will be different with that. 
I am going to start his plan in March and I will update with how it goes. BTW I have PCOS so I am really curious to see how it helps.  
Now, why 4 stars instead of 5.... If I could I would give 4.5 stars but Amazon doesn't allow that. In his recipes especially the smoothies he recommends his keto collagen, keto protein powder, bone broth power etc. That's great and all but what if we can't afford it, or don't like it, or we run out. It would have been nice if he would give us another option where we don't have to buy a blend or what happens if we are out. Like if he could have written next to it "or 2 tablespoons of college and 1 tablespoon of MTC oil." <--- that's just a random example don't take that to heart! That's my only real issue with the book. Otherwise, it's a fantastic book! Thank you, Dr. Axe!! God Bless :D

4.0 out of 5 stars Great information about doing Keto right 
Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
If you think keto dieting is about eating lots and lots of any type of fat, and little else, Dr. Axe will set you straight. According to Axe, you should be eating vegetables three times a day. Fresh, organic vegetables, and lots of them! Dr. Axe also recommends cyclical keto dieting for the long run, which seems healthy and far more doable than never eating carbs again.  
The reason I didn't give the book five stars is that it sets such a high standard, and calls for so many unrecognizable and difficult to find foods that a person could give up. I'm sure I could spend hundreds of dollars on herbs, strange foods, and supplements (sold by Dr. Axe), and most of them would sit on my shelf. I'm already very health conscious, and I find it overwhelming. Your average person isn't going to wake up Monday and be able to follow this to a T.  
Great things to know, but like a firehose. I hope people read this book and make changes to their diets and lifestyles, and are not discouraged by page after page about herbs and supplements and rules.

5.0 out of 5 stars Easy, practical read! Amazing recipes! 
Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
I first “met” Dr. Josh Axe through his Ancient Nutrition line! Then I became aware of his webpage and Instagram account! Both are extremely helpful as they focus on overall health: mind, body and spirit! Last week, I listed to Dr. Axe on the Ultimate Health Podcast. It was one of the best podcasts I’ve listened to. So much so that I’ve listened to it three times and sent it to many people! Dr. Axe shared a lot of what is in this book. He has a positive, holistic approach to health and life and it’s contagious! This book is powerful because it’s about “clean” Keto and gives many reasons why a Keto Diet can be advantageous for optimal health! I am grateful for his approach because he also mentions the importance of a spiritual routine and how that impacts stress levels and life. I appreciate that he keeps in mind that everyone is different and needs different plans based on their goals and health needs. He provides and explains multiple plans with sample menus for people who are looking to lose weight and improve their health, people who are looking to fast, people who choose a vegan diet, a cancer plan and my fave chapter, “Forever Keto Cycling Plan”. This is my favorite chapter because it addresses how to actually sustain Keto to promote long term success. He shares Chelsea’s (his wife) experience and also shares how his brother handles carb cycling! With all that said, I am probably most impressed by the wonderful recipes that are EASY to make and follow! I can’t wait to make the Keto pancakes or the slow cooker beef and broccoli.  
Finally, I always appreciate an approach that’s honest, focused on overall health and written in a way that’s easy to understand! Dr. Axe’s book is genuine and engaging because he refers to himself, family members and friends as examples which helps readers connect and better understand how it may work for them!

I really like the Axe man’s perspective on Keto. He’s explained about clean (vs dirty) keto, that I’d not been exposed to before. I also like the fact that he’s explained a Vegan version of the diet. When you also read about the herbs and supplements I think this is a very comprehensive guide to a healthy way of eating that’s not overly laboured.

2.0 out of 5 stars Bit fanatical about supplements and super foods which distracts from Keto. 
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 7, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
Clearly Dr Axe knows his stuff and is a loyal following. There is good stuff about Keto BUT he takes it far beyond Keto and preaches about supplements and super foods that have health benefits regardless of whether you are doing Keto or not. This is at the detriment of the keto message and distracts from practical day to day aspects of the diet. There is quite a lot of repetition about the supplements and superfoods. You have to read around a lot of this book if you’re just after simple guide to getting into Keto.
