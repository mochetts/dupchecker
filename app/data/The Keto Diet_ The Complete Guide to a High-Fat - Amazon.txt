Leanne provides the tools to empower everyone to develop a personalized nutrition plan, offering limitless options while taking away the many restrictions of a traditional ketogenic diet.  
A one-stop guide to the ketogenic way of eating, The Keto Diet shows you how to transition to and maintain a whole foods–based, paleo-friendly, ketogenic diet with a key focus on practical strategies—and tons of mouthwatering recipes.  
It includes:  
• Over 125 healthy and delicious whole-food recipes that will help your body burn fat, including:  
    • Chicken Crisps  
    • Bacon-Wrapped Mini Meatloaf’s  
    • Keto Sandwich Bread  
    • Waldorf-Stuffed Tomatoes  
    • No Nuts! Granola with Clusters  
    • Chicken Pot Pie  
    • Chocolate-Covered Coffee Bites  
• Five 28-day meal plans that walk you through a month of eating keto  
• Tools to make your high-fat life a breeze including guides for your favorite grocery stores, yes/no food lists, food sensitivity replacements, how to go dairy-free to reduce inflammation, and more  
The Keto Diet will help you gain energy, lose weight, improve your health, and turn you into the ultimate fat-burning machine—all without restricting or even counting calories. You’ll have all the tools you need to fall in love with your body and banish your fear of fat forever!

5.0 out of 5 stars What more? 
Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2017

What more can I really add to all the wonderful things that have already been written about this great book. I discovered Ketogenic Dieting in mid February of this year. I spent more than two weeks watching between 20 and 25 hours on youtube about this subject, and read many articles both pro, and con.  
Why all the research? I'm 64 years old and was pretty terrified at the prospect of eating this way. I also don't have a gallbladder to assist in fat assimilation. With cancer, diabetes, heart attacks and strokes on both sides of my family, I really didn't want to make any mistakes.  
In the 19 years I've been a member of Amazon, I've never once “Pre-ordered” anything, with the exception of this book. What sold me on this book was watching and listening to several dozen of Leanne's youtube video's and podcast postings. I found all of her information to be extremely well researched, and she consistently provided far more useful and important health information, of a higher value, than even most of the medical doctors who've posted on the same subjects. I decided to give it a shot, but still with some reluctance, as eating this way is totally counter intuitive to the way I've eaten for the last 40 years.  
Leanne has a funny sense of humor in both her video's and in her writing style. She's as delightful to read as she is to watch. I have followed her instructions for the last 6 weeks or so, and have effortlessly lost over 30 pounds. I have felt fully supported by her advice, including her suggestion of taking Ox Bile and Essential Enzymes to help with fat digestion, for those of us without a gallbladder. I haven't felt this great in many years, and will continue to eat this way from now on.  
If you're on a limited income as I am, and can only afford to purchase one or two books on this subject, drop this book in your cart. I have no doubt that you'll be very glad you did. Thank you, and thank you Leanne. This is truly a wonderful and life changing book.  
Updated - 3/1/18  
Before I get going and because of a comment posted below, I need to say that I have no connection with the publisher of this book. I don't know Leanne, any of her friends or anyone connected with the publishing of this book, The book was not given to me so I'd give it a nice review. I purchased it.  
In the comment section below, M.Kent suggested an update. When I went on this diet I was 6'4'' and was pushing 265 lbs. I wasn't hugely fat, just what people referred to as “really frigging large.” With the exception of my ex-mother-in-law who once told me, “Oh my God, you're enormous.” Sigh.  
I'm still 6'4'' (of course) but I weigh 225 lbs. I went on this diet not just lose weight, but to avoid some of the above stated illnesses that my family has experienced, mostly from a lack of solid health and nutritional information. God bless the internet.  
I will continue to eat this way because I feel and look healthier. I also noticed a reduction in the inflammation from the osteoarthritis in my spine. I don't eat sugar or sweets of any kind, and keep my carbs below 20 or 25 grams a day. I don't drive myself crazy anymore tracking macros or compulsively counting calories. Between protein and fat, getting enough fat was more of a challenge for me. I eat lots of Kerry Gold butter, Coconut oil, heavy cream, olive oil and lots of avocados. I occasionally use MCT oil.  
I plan to take my weight down to about 210 lbs by June or July. I've also integrated intermittent fasting into the mix. I eat during a four hour “eating window.” and have started doing a 72 hour fast once every three months. Leanne addresses fasting in her book.  
Being seriously committed to this type of eating, I've found it helpful to have a ketone blood tester to check on where I'm at, at different points. The breath and urine testers are a waste of money if you want accurate testing. The tester I found, and believe is the most accurate and least expensive is called Keto Mojo. It tests both ketones and glucose and if you purchase it from them, you're guaranteed to be able to purchase ketone test strips for only .99 cents, instead of the $2.00 to $7.00 each, as I've seen them listed for on the internet.  
Here are some other things I've found useful, on what first seemed like an odd journey of eating fat to be healthy.  
Greater Goods Nourish Digital Kitchen Food Scale. Great scale for the price, considering all it does. Available on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/Greater-Goods-Nourish-Portions-Nutritional/dp/B00O5U4NDQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518967663&sr=8-3&keywords=Greater+Goods+Nourish+Digital+Kitchen+Food+Scale  
Nuton MCT Oil which is both C10 and C8. I also sometimes use a C8 MCT Oil which is 99.6% C8 and is a bit more expensive. Both available on Amazon  
I've also found a short mimicking fasting diet, to be very helpful to getting fat adapted within a short period of time, without the hinderence of “keto flu.” One or two avocados and one or two greens drinks a day, launched my blood ketones from 0 to 4.2 mmol/L in only four days.  
The only other book I purchased, and only for the very serious is, The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living by Stephen Phinney, MD, PhD and Jeff Volek, PhD, RD.  
Everybody and every body is different and it takes a bit of experimentation to figure out what combination of these techniques (if any) are right for you. Take your time and have a good time with it. I hope this was helpful. I'm sorry it was so long.  
Best Wishes,  
Scott Walker

5.0 out of 5 stars I’ve tried them all...BUT THIS ONE WORKS!!!! 
Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018 
Verified Purchase 
This book has become my bible. I’m in my mid sixties and my weight gain hit me hard. I’ve tried every diet there is but instead of dieting now...I just eat a certain way. Who knew fat was good for you! Now I eat and truly enjoy my food. I don’t eat just chicken breast anymore...I GET TO EAT DARK MEAT! Avacados...go for it. The weight is dropping and I’m never hungry. I can go to any restaurant and find the right food to eat. Do I order pasta at an Italian restaurant...NO...I’ll order lamb chops, a steak, fish.Do I fall off sometimes...sure I do. But it’s so easy to pick right back up. I’ve lost 10lbs and can’t be happier because I’m truly enjoying food again. Just remember...slow and easy wins the race. Thank you Leanne for changing my life.

3.0 out of 5 stars Dairy Free Keto?! 
Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2018 
Verified Purchase 
Very disappointed that this is a dairy free book. The description of the book doesn’t mention that anywhere, so now I’m returning it. One of the things this book claims is to take away restrictions of other Keto plans, but not eating dairy is the worst case restriction for me. They should make it very clear that these recipes are dairy free!!

I have been doing keto for a year know. I've read a ton of information about keto and listen to keto poscaat as well. This is book is well written and is such a great resource book! She explains the ketogenic way of eating very well, provides 3 different paths to take to be successful and it has a ton of recipes. It's like getting 2 books in one....an informational book and a cook book! I initially bought the kindle version but loved it so much that I also bought the printed version! This is excellent for beginners as well as experiences ketogenic dieters!

Too many special ingredients needed. Hard to find a lot of them. 
Also, takes a lot of time to read through all the book- too much extra reading. Just wanted some new recipes.

I like the book, but the ingredient lists are very daunting with many obscure hard to find things listed. She keeps talking about not wanting to “count calories or macros” due to stress, but it’s stressful just thinking about the grocery list.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great for vegans too! 
Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2017 
Verified Purchase 
I am vegan and have tried to go keto in the past and failed due to lack of information. Before purchasing I messaged the author and asked if there were vegan recipes other than "dessert or snack type" foods and she told me that 42% of the recipes were either vegan or had an option to be made vegan. I LOVE this book! Though it does not include a meal plan for vegans specifically, the amount of information included in the book allowed me to create my own vegan keto meal plan. It also has a lot of helpful advice on how to deal with issues that may arise as your body transitions from sugar burning to fat burning. This book is so easy to read that it makes it possible for anyone to be keto!

3.0 out of 5 stars An American author. 
Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 31, 2019 
Verified Purchase 
This was an expensive book but the reviews were good so I ordered it. I was disappointed to discover that this book is by an American author and I feel specifically aimed at an American market. The recipes are measured in grams as well as cups but some ingredients are not familiar. There is a grocery store guide which is also American. 
It truly is a thorough book, though, with everything you need to start your Keto Journey but I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information in this book. There are five different types of Keto Diet for you to choose which best suits you, something that I personally became confused by. I just want a list of what I can and can’t eat and some recipes thrown in. 
The diet is also Paleo, so dairy free, Something I hadn’t realised when buying. She also rules out tomatoes and red peppers. At this point I decided that Leanne Vogel’s Keto was not for me.

My daughter has been doing a ketogenic diet, and I decided to help her. I found this book that is absolutely amazing. It has the best explanation of how the program works, and also outlines 5 different paths you can take - understanding that it isn't a one size fits all. Based on heath conditions, you can find the right path for you. It also has meal plans and great recipes. I was feeling overwhelmed before but this book makes me feel I can succeed. It has: 
- Education 
- Options 
- Shopping Lists 
- Meal Plans 
- Recipes 
I bought one for myself and one for a friend and now I'm feeling empowered!

3.0 out of 5 stars Nice book but not the lifestyle for me.

I really like a lot of aspects about this book. It's very readable, has a great layout and the description of some of the science behind the diet is explained in really simple terms. However, it probably achieved the opposite outcome to that intended in that it convinced me that this really is not the diet for me. It's a Paleo diet essentially which means no dairy at all. As a non meat eater I'd find it almost impossible to get enough protein as legumes are also excluded. 
Also, the process for working out the ratio of fats to carbs to proteins within a daily calorie target is just to cumbersome for every day living. 
Shame really, as I think the overall approach has much to recommend it.

What an amazing book. There's so much information, it's clearly laid out and crammed full of ideas and tips. All the recipes have photo's, metric measurement conversions, nutrient information, macro ratios. It explains which path to use once understanding your health status. If you want to understand Keto this book has all the answers. So well thought through.
